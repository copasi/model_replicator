# Tests for model replicator

This folder contains a variety of functional tests for *sbmodelr* that should cover all of its possible functions. Running all tests can be done by executing *run_all_tests.sh*

Included are four utilities that are used in some tests, (they require *pandas* and *scipy*):
 - *model_report.py* produces a text file with a readable report of a copasi or sbml file
 - *shapiro-wilk.py* reads numbers from a file and tests whether they look like normally distributed 
 - *ttest-mean.py* reads numbers from a file and tests whether their mean is different from a given value
 - *chisqtest-sd.py* reads numbers from a file and tests whether their stdev is different from a given value
 
## Structure

Each test resides in its own folder. Folders have names with format /^\d{4}_.*$/, the numeral being assigned sequentially, followed by a tag. A folder *sources* contains original files (SBML, COPASI and GraphViz files), as they can be re-used in several tests.
 - a brief *README.md* describing the functionality that is being tested
 - a *run.sh* script that runs the test and that carries out any needed comparisons so that it announces **PASS** or **FAIL**; note that this may execute a series of calls to *sbmodelr*, the utilities mentioned above, unix utilities (*awk*, *bc*, *grep*, *sed*), and it may also run the resulting file with COPASI
 - a file *target_stdout* containing the expected *stdout* output from a correct execution (ideally this should be a read-only file)
 - potentially files with results from COPASI runs to be compared against runs of the result files (no specific names prescribed)

## Functionality

Tests should focus on:

 **1. positive tests** with numbers 0001 to 0500

 - 1D, 2D and 3D architectures
 - adding a medium unit
 - sets with and without connections
 - connections on 1D architectures with specified networks
 - unidirectional and bidirectional connections in specified networks
 - connections on reaction-dependent species with mass action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics
 - connections on species ODEs with diffusive and synaptic coupling
 - connections on global quantity ODEs with diffusive and synaptic coupling
 - connections on compartment ODEs with diffusive coupling
 - adding noise, uniform and Gaussian, to specific parameters
 - adding noise, uniform and Gaussian, to connection parameters
 - combinations of all the above

 **2. negative tests** with numbers 0501 to 1000

 These are tests that check that failures happen as expected (i.e. should generate errors)

 - loading random files fails with error message
 - synaptic coupling in compartment connections
 - invalid GraphViz files
 - parameter noise that results in negative values that should be non-negative
