# 0014_CalciumSpiking

grid of 2x2 units with Calcium Spiking model defined by species ODEs and connected by diffusive connections of *Calcium-Cyt*

## tests

- 2D, 2x2 grid, diffusive connection species ODE
- cps file reads well
- checks that coupling constant exists and is set to default value
- checks that there are 4 ODEs which contain the diffusive terms
