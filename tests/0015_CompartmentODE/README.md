# 0015_CompartmentODE

set of 2 units of model with compartment ODEsand connected by diffusive connections of *vesicle*

## tests

- 1D, 2 units, network, diffusive connection compartment ODE
- SBML file reads well
- network file reads well
- checks that coupling constant exists and is set to default value
- checks that there are 2 ODEs which contain the diffusive terms
