# Gene regulatory networks

This example takes a base unit defining a simple model for expression of one gene and uses it to create gene regulatory networks. When creating this type of networks *sbmodelr* adds one synthesis reaction to each species where that reaction has a number of effectors (determined by the topology) and each effector can be an inducer or repressor, according to a kinetic function that multiplies one generic term per effector. The equation is expressed as:

![Generic equation for regulatory synthesis networks](Eq1.png)

where *V* is a maximal rate parameter, *M_i* is the effector species, *h_i* is a Hill coefficient that expresses a degree of cooperativity (can be any integer between 1-10), and *a_i* is a parameter that encodes the sign and strength of the interaction; *a_i* can be any value between -1 and +1, where -1 is full strength repression, and +1 is full strength induction; a value of zero makes that effector have no effect. Note that this equation makes the effect of all effectors to be non-additive (*e.g.* if one term becomes zero, the rate will be zero irrespective of the concentrations of any other effector). The effect of each effector *M_1* (*i.e.* the value of their corresponding regulatory term) is represented graphically below, showing the effect of *a_i* and *h_i* parameters.

### Case 1

We create a small network of inhibitory genes, known as the "repressilator", described by Elowitz and Leibler (1). This network consists of three genes inhibiting each other in a triangle. The network is expressed by the file *3circle.gv*:

```
digraph _3circle{
// three nodes affecting each other in a circle
1 -> 2
2 -> 3
3 -> 1
}
```


File *ex6case1.sh* contains the full *sbmodelr* command required to create the new model.
